<h1> the u.s.’s rapid descent into technoligarchy </h1>

<p>*This document is a work in progress. The government is collapsing faster than I can update it [February 24, 2025].* As of this moment [January 2025], nine out of ten of the biggest companies in the world by market cap are tech companies. The other is Saudi Arabian oil. Trump’s inauguration was attended by some of the richest people in the world, particularly tech billionaires and CEOs. Namely, Elon Musk, the wealthiest man alive, Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest man alive, and Mark Zuckerberg, the fourth wealthiest man alive. These three men were seated front and center, in front of Trump’s own cabinet picks. In his farewell address to the U.S., during a rare moment of lucidity, Biden called out the “oligarchy taking shape in America” and warned of the “potential rise of a tech-industrial complex”.

In a very Trump fashion, this shift is unfolding rapidly and publicly; I don’t doubt that more is going on behind the scenes, but his administration isn’t taking any measures towards subtlety. Trump Presidency 2.0 aside, the digital world has never been apolitical, and the further we integrate technology into our daily lives, the more our social, political, and digital worlds tangle and intermix.

We’re seeing tech CEOs and billionaires exponentially grow in wealth and political power. We can recognize the societal dependence on these companies forming. We know our algorithms are tailored, our media is censored, and Amazon is evil but convenient. There is a lot of fear, and a general, understandable, collective energy of nihilistic helplessness amidst the country. Simultaneously, the tech itself that we have access to and the way we use it is rapidly changing. Inherently, as technology improves, it does more of the work for us. We don’t need to learn code to build a website-at this point, we can literally tell AI exactly what we want and it will build a website for us. Digital inner workings become incomprehensible; we are all using machines we don’t at all understand. The fear is that the machines are becoming smarter, humanity is becoming dumber through our reliance on them, and one day they will take over and probably kill us all. The real, current threat is that there are people that own, control, and train the machines, the AI, the algorithms, the companies, and they are nearly all straight, rich, white men. 

Women, queer people, people of color have forefronted technological advancement throughout history. As we currently stand, there are many, many barriers to the world of tech to anyone who isn’t a silicon valley bro. There has been a significant recent movement recently towards women in STEM etc, but the disparities in representation are still vast (we know they don’t really want us there). Point being, this isn’t an issue of “the master’s tools”. These have been our tools since the beginning, it's time to reclaim them.

I suppose this is a plea, not for digital primitivism, but internet decolonization. I barely remember life pre-Facebook, but I do remember when 50+% of the websites I came across were in Times New Roman. When the internet felt like moving through a giant, vast, unknown network to explore, rather than a dark predetermined tunnel, vaguely connected to other dark predetermined tunnels. It would be nice if we all did a mass Instagram exodus, and some messianic anti-authoritarian programmer created an anti-Metaverse, accessible, open platform of interconnectivity, the perfect hub for creating community and building a new digital world. But realistically, I believe that autonomous education and action is achievable and essential to navigating, hopefully changing, the world we’re creating.

I’m not suggesting every U.S. resident becomes fluent in web development, nor that that alone would put us (the people) on a remotely even playing field with them (big government billionaire tech bros). However I do believe that everyone with the time and resources to do so would benefit from developing a level of technological literacy.

I’m thinking of this in two ways. 1. the potential to revolt and rewrite our digital world, and 2. tangible, immediate actions we can take as individuals.

1: 

2: If we learn about how [social media] algorithms work, and the ways in which they are being used to divide and silence, we can better understand our own biases, widen our perspectives, and critically consume our media. If we promote technology education to our youth and community, more marginalized identities will join the industry, resulting in a digital experience that better understands and serves the people within it. If we better comprehend the tools we use, we can use them better.

 I think we’re all still wrapping our heads around what the internet is, beyond how it works, how we understand it in relation to space and time and our human perception of the world.

The internet is expanding continuously, but it feels like it, or at least the space within it that we reside, is getting smaller. More controlled, perfectly personalized and curated, fragmented, isolated. Easier to use and harder to really comprehend. 


tldr; everyone is scared because of the sci fi supervillain tech bros that are now the government. when we start feeling like the machines are controlling us, we need to be thinking about who’s controlling the machines. basically, the internet is real life but another place, we have the potential to shape it.
